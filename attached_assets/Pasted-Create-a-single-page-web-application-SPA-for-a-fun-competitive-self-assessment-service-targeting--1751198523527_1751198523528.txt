Create a single-page web application (SPA) for a fun, competitive self-assessment service targeting global users, hosted on Cloudflare Pages. The website calculates a user's rank based on personal achievements (excluding parental influence) and displays individual and total grades with explanations. Support multiple languages: Korean (ko), English (en), Japanese (ja), Chinese (zh, Simplified), and Spanish (es). Use React with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly design, and integrate i18next for multilingual support. The app should be engaging, intuitive, and optimized for ad integration (e.g., Google AdSense).
